# Rust State Machine (PBA-X Task)

This project is a Rust-based implementation of a finite state machine (FSM), developed as part of the **PBA-X** educational program. It follows the course ["Build a Finite State Machine in Rust"](https://dotcodeschool.com/courses/rust-state-machine) by DotCodeSchool, with the goal of deepening understanding of Rust's type system, enums, traits, and compile-time safety guarantees.

## Project Purpose

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how to build a safe, robust, and extensible finite state machine in Rust. The implementation emphasizes **type safety**, **pattern matching**, and **ownership semantics**, making full use of Rustâ€™s strengths.

## Running the Example

To build and run the project:
```bash
cargo run
```

To run tests:
```bash
cargo test
```

## Learning and Outcomes
By completing this project, I gained practical experience with:

- Designing finite state machines in a functional way.
- Leveraging the Rust type system to enforce valid transitions.
- Structuring modular and extensible Rust applications.
- Using traits and ownership to prevent runtime errors.
